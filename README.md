## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, now featuring an interactive user interface. The game runs in the browser and uses JavaScript for functionality, allowing players to compete against the computer.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Players make choices using clickable buttons instead of text prompts.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Results and scores are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
- **Game Logic**: Handles multiple rounds and displays the game outcome when a player reaches 5 points.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for enhanced visual presentation, including fonts and button states.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click one of the buttons: "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" to make your choice.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The result of each round and the updated scores will be displayed on the webpage.
5. The game continues until one player reaches 5 points, at which point the game outcome will be displayed, and the scores will reset.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the game structure.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for game styling.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing game logic and DOM manipulation.
